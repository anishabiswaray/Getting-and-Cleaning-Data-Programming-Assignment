Instructions

Download the data set, https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip.

Unzip the data set into your working dicrectory and you should see a folder named UCI HAR Dataset.

Make sure the folder and the run_analysis.R script are both in the current working directory.

Load RStudio and set your working directory using setwd("") and load the R script using source("run_analysis.txt").

Use run_analysis() to execute the function, and  merged_tidy_data.txt and calculated_tidy_data.txt would be replaced.
